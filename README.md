                      Geometry tool
An ultimate guide to a universe of geometric magic
									

1.	Introduction.
Geometry tool is a written in C++ project that executes the following operation:
1) Checks whether a particular point lies on a given line.
       2)  Finds a line paralel to another through a given point.
       3)  Finds a line perpendicular to another in a particular point.
       4)  Finds the intersection point of two lines.
       5)  Finds the equations of the heights, medians and bisectors of a triangle.
       6)  Finds the equation(s) of the tangent line(s) to a parabola through a given point.
       7)  Finds the intersection points of a line and a parabola.
       8)  Determines the kind of the quadrangle that 4 lines form .

2.	Some particular characteristics.
-	the equations of the lines, forming the triangle, should be entered in a particular order (AB, BC, CD, AD); otherwise, the program may not perform some of the expected operations correctly;
-	all of the lines need to be presented with their widely accepted equations (a*x + b*y + c = 0) in the user’s input; in the output, however, the “y = k*x + n”- form of lines will be visualized (for esthetic reasons);
-	due to the use of the round()- function, some of the results may be relatively correct (with small and insignificant difference).

3.	Main aim of this project.
-	Key idea: Geometry tool, when used correctly, is a powerful tool that helps solving numerous problems related to analytical geometry;
-	This project is also believed to have enhanced the learning process of many FMI – students – a benefit that may even expand the use of such programs in the future.

4.	Conclusion.
-	Why? 
I have chosen this project because, quite frankly, I enjoy solving geometric problems (and coding tediously long programs as well);
-	I hope you find this project interesting and effective in executing all of the operations needed. Also, I will appreciate some feedback for future improvement.

Thank you for your attention and personal time!
